# Mobile Development with React Native and Expo

## Task 0: Setting Up and Testing Your Mobile Development Environment

This document outlines the steps I took to set up my mobile development environment for React Native using the Expo Framework.

### Tools and Environment
- **Operating System:** [Your operating system, e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux]
- **Node.js LTS:** Installed and verified.
- **VS Code:** Installed as the primary IDE.
- **Expo Go:** Installed on my physical device.

### Setup Process
1.  **Node.js LTS and VS Code**: I confirmed that both Node.js and VS Code were already installed on my machine as per the task requirements.
2.  **Expo Go Installation**: I visited `https://expo.dev/go` and installed the Expo Go app on my [Your phone's OS, e.g., Android] device from the [Google Play Store/Apple App Store].
3.  **Account Creation/Login**: I opened the Expo Go app and logged in to my Expo account.

### Challenges Faced
* **[If you faced any challenges, describe them here. For example: "Initially, I had a problem with my firewall blocking the connection between the Expo development server and my phone. I resolved this by adding an exception for Node.js in my firewall settings."]**
* **[If no significant challenges were faced, you can simply state it here: "The setup process was straightforward, and I did not encounter any major challenges."]**

### Conclusion
The development environment is now ready for the upcoming projects. Expo Go provides an efficient and cost-effective way to test applications directly on a physical device without the need for an emulator, which simplifies the mobile development workflow.
